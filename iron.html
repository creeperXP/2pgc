    <p> Iron is a pure soul so here's a poem: </p> <br>
    <p> In the realm of pixels and code so bright,<br>
        Where dreams take shape in the digital light,<br>
        Stands a name that echoes through every line,<br>
        Irondiamond595, uniquely divine.<br><br>
        
        A warrior of logic, with a heart of steel,<br>
        Crafting worlds where imagination can heal.<br>
        Through challenges faced and victories won,<br>
        A spark of creativity, shining like the sun.<br><br>
        
        With every keystroke, a story unfolds,<br>
        Adventures in lands where courage beholds.<br>
        From the depths of the night to the break of dawn,<br>
        Irondiamond595, forever drawn.<br><br>
        
        A beacon of brilliance, in shadows they rise,<br>
        Transforming the mundane into wondrous skies. <br>
        So hereâ€™s to the journey, the paths yet untrod,<br>
        To Irondiamond595, a creator, a god.</p>
